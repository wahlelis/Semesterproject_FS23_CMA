## Abstract

## Introduction
As mountainbiking is a popular sport in Switzerland (Fischer et al., 2021), both environmental and policy issues arise (Pröbstl-Haider et al., 2018). It is deemed necessary to find a way to not only meet the requirements of bikers and hikers but also of nature. In order to be able to talk about these issues on an objective level, it could be of interest to find out more about mountainbiking from a spatial use and movement based perspective. 
In this project, we aim at filtering mountainbiking movement patterns in crowdsourced movement data according to specific movement criteria which should only apply to mountianbikers.

In this project, we aim at defining criteria that indicate mountainbiking movement patterns, and try to provide information about the characteristics of mountainbiking. 

## Research Question
In this paper we will work on the following two research questions: 
- With which criteria can we filter a downhill oriented mountainbiking movement pattern from Posmo data? 
- Is this combination of criteria applicable to all our data?


## Data and Methods

The movement Data is provided by Lisa Wahlen's gps-tracking App *posmo*. Lisa completed 6 mountainbiking tours in the period from the 4th of May to the 18th of May 2023. All tours except for one were done in Switzerland in the areas of Allmiried (Diemtigtal), Valbirse and Solothurn. One tour was tracked in Germany, near Todtnau. 


For the assessment of the criteria that describe the movement pattern of mountain biking, we used the MOPUBE dataset providing the land cover types of the canton of Bern (Amt für Geoinformation des Kantons Bern, 2023). 

### Dataset
For our project, we used the movement trajectories that were created by ourselves when going mountainbiking. The data was created by using posmo.ch. As the sampling rate is at 10 seconds, the sampling rate is rather low. 
To filter the movement pattern of mountainbiking we further used the following data: 

- posmo trajectories: sampling rate, 10 s
- SwissAlti3D: This elevation data is provided by the government of switzerland in a resolution of 0.5 m. It is provided in grids of 1 km2 for all of Switzerland as bot a .tif file and a .xyz file. For the project here, we used the .tif files.
- MOPUBE BBF: Ground type of the canton of Bern

### Preprocessing


### Methods
In order to filter the mountainbiking pattern, we defined three criteria with which we should be able to have a unique identifier. Those three criteria consist of the speed with which the person is moving, the groundtype on which the trajectory is laying and furthermore the steepness of the trajectory, which needs to be directed downhill. 
Using just one or two of the criteria will always still allow for other activities. Such that a trajectory placed on grass and in forests could still also be a hiker, which also applies to the downhill movement. The Speed of a mountainbiker is hard to define, but it is also not a unique identifier for this movement pattern. 

#### Speed

#### Groundtype


#### Steepness

#### Combination of all criteria

### Limitations
- we should try our code on another mountainbike pattern from Lisa to find whether its applicable to all patterns.
