## Abstract

<!-- (50-60 words) -->

## Research Questions

<!-- (50-60 words) -->

-   How can we detect bikers?

-   How do sinuosity and turning angle influence the speed of bikers?

-   Can we detect the influence of turning angles on the speed of bikers?

-   How do sinuosity influence the choice of bikepath of bikers?

-   Can we detect differences in bikepath choices?

## Results / products

<!-- What do you expect, anticipate? -->

We expect that the turning angle generally decreases the speed of the bikers.

## Data

<!-- What data will you use? Will you require additional context data? Where do you get this data from? Do you already have all the data? -->

We will use the data from the data - pool of all students of this class. The data has been collected by gps as well as by using the posmo app. For this type of evaluation, the date and time of the collection of the data is irrelevant. The sampling rate on the other hand, is needed to assess the speed.

## Analytical concepts

<!-- Which analytical concepts will you use? What conceptual movement spaces and respective modelling approaches of trajectories will you be using? What additional spatial analysis methods will you be using? -->

## R concepts

<!-- Which R concepts, functions, packages will you mainly use. What additional spatial analysis methods will you be using? -->

We will further use R packages such as dplyr for data wrangling and tidyverse.

## Risk analysis

<!-- What could be the biggest challenges/problems you might face? What is your plan B? -->

The research questions are ambitious, as we need to first filter cyclists from other means of movement and then find different relevant definitions. It is for example up do discussion, how we define the relevant turning angles and what sinuosity is relevant.

If we find ourselves overwhelmed with the task, we will shorten our project and try to focus on the detection of bicycle use.

## Questions?

<!-- Which questions would you like to discuss at the coaching session? -->
