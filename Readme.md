## Abstract

<!-- (50-60 words) -->

## Research Questions

<!-- (50-60 words) -->

How can we detect bikers?

How do sinuosity and turning angle influence the speed of bikers?

How do sinuosity influence the choice of bikepath of bikers?

## Results / products

<!-- What do you expect, anticipate? -->

## Data

<!-- What data will you use? Will you require additional context data? Where do you get this data from? Do you already have all the data? -->

## Analytical concepts

<!-- Which analytical concepts will you use? What conceptual movement spaces and respective modelling approaches of trajectories will you be using? What additional spatial analysis methods will you be using? -->

## R concepts

<!-- Which R concepts, functions, packages will you mainly use. What additional spatial analysis methods will you be using? -->

## Risk analysis

<!-- What could be the biggest challenges/problems you might face? What is your plan B? -->

## Questions?

<!-- Which questions would you like to discuss at the coaching session? -->
